# Benchmarks

Benchmarks were run with 1,000 samples per variable (i.e. setting each input matrix to have 1,000 rows). The number of variables in `a_mat` was set to 100, and the number of variables in `b_mat` was varied as shown below. The number of pairwise comparisons (equivalent to the product of the column counts of `a_mat` and `b_mat`) is also indicated.

Benchmarks were run on an i7-7700K with 16GB of 2133 MHz RAM. GPU benchmarks were performed on a GTX 1080.
